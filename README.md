# The brickvox project

This small project has been in development for over a year, it might still have mistakes that I may have done, so please report any issues
the game it's mostly tested for linux only and it's a multiplayer procedurally generated game. The server contains many files, and requires mysql for working
while the client it's customizable.

Any doubts on the development and how to customize join the official discord server: https://discord.gg/KrXdkeCDPe
